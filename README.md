## Components Needed

- Arduino UNO
- LED
- 220Ω Resistor
- Push Button
- Breadboard
- Jumper Wires

## Circuit Connections

1. **LED Connections**
   - Connect the **long leg (anode)** of the LED to **digital pin 13** of Arduino through a 220Ω resistor.
   - Connect the **short leg (cathode)** of the LED to **GND**.

2. **Button Connections**
   - Connect one side of the push button to **digital pin 2** of Arduino.
   - Connect the other side of the button to **GND**.
   - Use the **internal pull-up resistor** in Arduino (optional) to avoid floating input.
